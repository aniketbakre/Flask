1. **Importing the Flask module:** Import the `Flask` class from the `flask` module.

2. **Creating the Flask application instance:** Create an instance of the Flask application using the `Flask(__name__)` constructor. The `__name__` variable represents the name of the current module.

3. **Defining the route and view function:** Use the `@app.route` decorator to define a route for the root URL ("/"). This decorator associates the specified URL with the following function. In this case, the function is named `My_name()`.

4. **Implementing the view function:** Define the `My_name()` function, which will be called when the root URL is accessed. Inside this function, return the string "Hello!! I am Aniket Bakre." as the response.

5. **Running the Flask application:** Check if the script is being executed directly (not imported as a module) using the `__name__` variable. If it is the main script, start the Flask development server by calling `app.run()`. The server will listen for incoming requests and respond with the appropriate route handlers.

Remember to install Flask (`pip install flask`) before running this code.
